There have been many many times when I need to convert *something* to PDF format from a back-end application.  It seems like it&#8217;s hard to find a tool to do the job the way I want it done.  I&#8217;ve resorted to third-party tools on occasion but hate overpaying for tools that bother me with their annoying licensing tricks and do more than what I need for the price I pay.  I decided I needed a server that would accept many types of sources (documents, images, Urls, etc.) and convert them to PDF without a fuss.  Fortunately there  are some great open source tools that I was able to leverage to accomplish this.  I decided assimilate these tools and write an production grade, open source PDF conversion server.

### Introducing pedamorf

**pedamorf** is a server that converts documents, images, urls, html and text to PDF. It relies heavily upon the excellent open-source projects wkhtml2pdf, Libre Office and iTextSharp. A .NET client library is provided for easy usage.

### Features

  * Converts the following sources:
      * documents: **doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, odt**
      * images: **png, gif, jpg/jpeg, bmp**
      * **html**: Can convert any Url or Html source. For instance, you can ask pedamorf to convert a Url like http://www.github.com or pass in html text for conversion.
      * text: **txt, rtf**
  * Can convert multiple files / urls at one time and combine them into a single PDF.
  * Supports various options (depending upon the source type) that enable you to specify PDF orientation, image size, custom css stylesheet (html source) and more.
  * Can convert files within a directory to a single PDF.
  * Can convert a zip file containing documents and images into a single PDF.
