<img src="/media/dna-300x157.jpg" alt="dna" class="pull-left" />A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to give a presentation at our all-hands company meeting. We take turns each month and my number was up. The topic can be *anything* and the idea is to teach the team something new. I thought a good topic would be DNA because having previously worked at [FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com/) for the past 2 years, I learned some pretty interesting things that I not only wanted to share but also organize in my head so I would have a better understanding of what I learned.

So, I put together a presentation called &#8220;Understanding DNA&#8221; which aims to be a 101 on DNA: what it is, where it is found, how we analyze it and, what can be done with it.

It was fun to put together and helped me organize what I learned so that hopefully I will remember it.

DNA is definitely a geeky subject so naturally I had to post it here as well.
