I&#8217;m a big fan of Picasa.  I love the <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">client app</a> because it is powerful yet easy to use (and free!).  And, I love the integration with the web in Picasa Web Albums because I can use the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/overview.html" target="_blank">Picasa Web Albums Data API</a> to control my albums online.

I previously wrote a syncing tool called <a href="/picasawebsync/" target="_blank">PicasaWebSync</a> which I run daily to sync my local photos to my online albums automatically.  Using the nice <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/web-albums-a-picasa-photo/id344997890?mt=8" target="_blank">Web Albums</a> app on my iPhone, I can easily pull up photos that were synced automatically.  I don&#8217;t have to pull out the USB cord and sync with iTunes, pay for iCloud storage, or buy an iPhone that has a larger capacity.

Anyway, since I have all my albums uploaded and synced automatically I wanted a way to display slideshows on my various websites so I could show some photos off!  I looked around for a nice jQuery plugin to do this, and although there were one or two candidates, I wasn&#8217;t fully happy with them.  And, I thought it would be fun to write my own.
