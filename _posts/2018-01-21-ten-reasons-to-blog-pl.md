I have been blogging for just over 8 years and recently thought about why I continue to blog. It's entirely by choice, after all, but I keep doing it and here are 10 reasons, in no particular order, why:

1. **Help others** - you get to help others learn the things you've learned. It feels good to share with others and help them along
1. **Help your future self** - your blog is a great place to post things you want to reference yourself in the future
1. **Practice communicating** - blogging exercises your writing and communication skills so you'll get better at those
1. **Enhance career opportunities** - maintaining a blog a is a great way to impress prospective employers by demonstrating expertise and passion
1. **Have fun tweaking** - I find it fun to maintain a blogging platform (tweaking this or that, moving to another platform, setting up tooling or scripts)
1. **Understand better** - you understand things better when you teach them to others through a blog
1. **Learn new things** - whether it is doing some digging to support part of a post, researching what others have posted on a subject, or asking others for help to prepare for a post, you learn new things along the way
1. **Build community** - when people leave a comment or engage through another syndicated platform you can build community and make friends
1. **Own your content** - blogging, as opposed to posting content on other social sites, allows you to centralize and own your own content
1. **Learn from others** - soliciting feedback on a blog allows you to learn from others
