title: "10 Reasons to Blog"
---

I have been blogging for just over 8 years and recently thought about why I continue to blog. It's entirely by choice, after all, but I keep doing it and here are 10 reasons why (in no particular order):

1. **Help others** - you get to help others learn
1. **Practice communicating** - blogging exercises your writing and communication skills
1. **Understand better** - you understand things better when you teach them to others
1. **Wider reach** - rather than posting something on another site, blogging is easily syndicated and shared elsewhere
1. **Self reference in the future** - your blog is a great place to post things you want to reference in the future
1. **Meet people** - When people leave a comment or engage through another syndicated platform you can meet people and make friends
1. **Career opportunities** - maintaining a blog a is a great way to impress prospective employers - to demonstrate expertise and passion.
1. **Fun** - I find it fun to maintain a blogging platform; the endless tweaking and such.
1. Give back
1. Learn things
