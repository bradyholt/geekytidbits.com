Today I gave a &#8220;tech talk&#8221; at work on Entity Framework.  The audience was a mix of .NET, Ruby/Rails, and C++ developers so I tried to keep the content balanced between high-level information (for those unfamiliar) and lower-level details to keep those that work with EF interested and (hopefully) learning something new.  A few questions came up at the end that I didn&#8217;t know the answers to so I went and found out and this proved to be a good learning process.  I learned a few things about EF today that I think are helpful.  Anyway, it was a good experience to freshen up on my overall knowledge of Entity Framework and to get more practice presenting in front of technical peers.  Below is the slide deck I used.

By the way, I used [slides.com][1] (based on the freaking awesome [reveal.js][2] framework) for the presentation.  I was nothing but impressed and will be back next time I need to throw some slides together.
