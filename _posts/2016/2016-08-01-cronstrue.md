Way back in 2012, I started work on and eventually released a library called [cron-expression-descriptor](https://github.com/bradyholt/cron-expression-descriptor) which takes a cron expression and describes the cron scheduled in human readable text.  You know, `*/5 * * * *` > `"Every 5 minutes"`.  It filled a need and gained quite a bit of usage and contribution activity from the community.  It would be translated to 14 languages and ported to Java, Ruby and Python.  It was a fun library to write, maintain and use as a catalyst to learn new things (like handling i18n in .NET and publishing a package to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)).

A few weeks ago I was listening to the [Changelog podcast, episode #210](https://changelog.com/210/) with Alan Shreve, the smart guy behind [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  Alan mentioned that the way he likes to learn a new language/ecosystem is to take an existing codebase and port it over.  I like this approach, and agree.  It prompted me to port cron-expression-descriptor over to JavaScript since I am using JavaScript more and more these days at work and on side projects.  Just when I think I have a fairly good handle on JavaScript, I realize there is so much more for me to learn.  Porting this library over to JavaScript would be a good opportunity to learn not only JavaScript syntax in a deeper way but also the everchanging ecosystem and tooling around it.

So, I started work on a JavaScript port which I eventually named [cRonstrue](https://github.com/bradyholt/cron-expression-descriptor) (I like this name much more than cron-expression-descriptor, BTW ðŸ˜€).  I used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the source, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (with [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)) for unit tests, and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for bundling the final distributables.  I learned a bunch of stuff along the way and it was fun!
