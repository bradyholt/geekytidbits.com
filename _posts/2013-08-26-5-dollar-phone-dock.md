**Let&#8217;s face it: the cost of phone docks can be outrageous**.  A simple<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC596ZM/B/apple-iphone-4-dock" target="_blank"> iPhone dock costs $29.00</a> and a typical <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RND-Nexus-compatible-without-slim-fit/dp/B00ASQPLOG/ref=br_lf_m_1001095131_1_1_ttl?ie=UTF8&s=wireless&pf_rd_p=1602828162&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_i=1001095131&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1WTSV0B8Y4SDHDXDE8ZZ" target="_blank">dock for the Nexus 4 can run about $20</a>.  Buying a dock that will fit a phone with a case is tough too.  Some of them say they support phones with cases but I have purchased at least 2 in recent past which in fact did not work with *my* case.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to have to take your case off just to dock your phone.

So, I decided to go the easy, simple route.  Enter: the $5 Phone Dock.  Yes, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/346429/Office-Depot-Brand-Metro-Mesh-Business/" target="_blank">mesh business card holder from Office Depot</a>.  It works like a champ!  It fits virtually every phone, is easy to plug your existing charger in and works great!
