Last weekend, I was invited by Houston&#8217;s First Baptist Church to give a presentation on &#8220;Using Technology Effectively in a Bible Study&#8221; at their <a href="http://houstonsfirst.org/event/526613-2015-01-23-midnight-madness/" target="_blank">Midnight Madness</a> event.  This is an annual training event for leadership and is intended to equip Bible study leaders to be effective.  There were lots of interesting sessions and if I wasn&#8217;t presenting I would have definitely wanted to attend a few sessions.

Preparing for this session was a good learning process.  Although I already had a rough idea for some content, based on my own experience using technology in a Bible study, I needed to polish up some areas and dive in a bit deeper with researching tools and technologies.  I found some interesting tools along the way and was able to frame the the session around answering the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; questions.  The attendees to my two sessions were varied in their experience and comfort level with using online technologies so I had to be accommodating to that.  Overall, I am glad I volunteered to give the talk and am thankful for the opportunity to have served the church.

I decided to use Google Slides and a Chromecast for the presentation.  One reason I thought the Chromecast would be good is because I wanted to demo a few apps on my Android smartphone throughout the presentation and switching between casting from my laptop for Google Slides and my Nexus 5 (<a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2014/07/09/cast-screen-button-now-works-for-screen-mirroring-to-chromecast/" target="_blank">Cast Screen</a>) is seamless and clean.  Something I found along the way was that I could open speaker notes when casting a Google Slides presentation which allowed me to see my notes, slides and a timer.  This allowed me to have two &#8220;views&#8221; which I didn&#8217;t think was possible with Chromecast but it turns out to be perfect for a presentation.

I covered these areas of use for technology:

  * Communication
  * Sign-Up Tools
  * Podcasts
  * Websites
  * Misc Tools

Here is my slide deck:
