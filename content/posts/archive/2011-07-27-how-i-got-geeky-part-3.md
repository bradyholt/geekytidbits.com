In [Part 1][1] and [Part 2][2] of How I Got Geeky, you learned how I bought a CB radio for $5 at a garage sell and through a series of buys and sells ended up getting my first computer for $150 when I was 14 years old.

### Playing with Computers

I had a lot of fun with my x386 computer. Although limited with what I could run on it, I mostly tweaked around with settings and such to learn how it worked. There were a few games I could play on it but most of the time I was doing things other than playing them.

I eventually bought and installed a modem (2400 *baud*, remember?) and started a BBS (Bulletin Board System) called &#8220;The Hard Drive&#8221;, powered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemoteAccess" target="_blank">RemoteAccess</a>, which ended up being lots of fun. It had some games and file downloads mostly. In the pre-mainstream internet days, BBS was your way to &#8220;connect&#8221;. Since I didn&#8217;t have a dedicated phone line I could only have it running at night while my folks were sleeping. I don&#8217;t think I ever told them about that!

After having a blast with my x386 computer for about a year, lightening struck our house and zapped it. With some insurance money (and probably some extra $ thrown in by my parents that I didn&#8217;t know about) I was able to get a custom built (by a family friend) x486 that had decent specs. It had a 200MB hard drive, 4MB of RAM, and a VGA monitor. I was now able to use AOL, play games that had decent graphics and other cool things I hadn&#8217;t been able to do with my older x386, because it had the very limited CGA monitor.

### Programming

Awhile later, toward the end of my 8th grade year, I was hanging out with a guy I knew from church, <a href="http://www.mudpoet.org/" target="_blank">Travis</a>, and he mentioned something about how he knew how to program computers. This immediately got my attention because I had been very interested in learning how to do that but had no idea where to start. &#8220;Computer Programmer&#8221; had the coolest connotation for me. You know, the geek equivalent for something like &#8220;Black Stealth Ninja&#8221;.

At my request, he began to walk me through the nuts and bolts of programming with Borland&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal" target="_blank">Turbo Pascal</a>. He got me setup on my computer and showed me the basics. He then started to give me programming &#8220;assignments&#8221;. Some of them were simple logic algorithms and others were mini-applications. I made screen savers, a magic 8 ball, computer password utilities, and a Tic-Tac-Toe program. Â <a href="https://github.com/bradymholt/pascal-scratch" target="_blank">Check them out on GitHub</a>! It was seriously fun to me.

My first &#8220;professional&#8221; gig as a programmer was to create a screensaver for the full service car wash I worked at when I was 15. I was friends with the manager&#8217;s son and he knew I was computer savvy. He said he would pay me $20.00 to build a screen saver for the company computer. Admittedly, the screen saver I ended up with was rudimentary but it did the job. I was getting paid to be a programmer!

So, it was obvious I liked computers. And it was more than obvious that I liked to program them. One day my sister Becky placed a print-out about a degree program at The University of Texas at Austin called Management Information Systems. I read the blurb about &#8220;Is This Right For You?&#8221; and it sounded right up my alley. I liked the idea of being in the business world yet knowing technology deeply. I didn&#8217;t just want to be a coder locked in the backroom but a savvy business person that had development skills that could be applied to business problems.

### Fast Forward

Fifteen years later, here I am. After graduating from UT, I entered the professional world as a developer and have had a variety of roles and responsibilities. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work in quite a few industries and see some pretty fascinating technology. Through and through, I've never lost my [love of programming](/why-i-love-programming).

So there you have it. That&#8217;s **How I Got Geeky**.
