Software development, in a nutshell, is a disciplined approach to creating software to meet a need.  It involves many activities including design, testing, QA, project management and more.   This is what I do professionally and can honestly say I enjoy it.

*Programming*, on the other hand, is raw slinging of code. It&#8217;s writing code to make your computer do something&#8230;anything.  Sure, software development involves a good deal of actual programming but I think you  need to distinguish the two.

One thing I know for sure about about programming itself is that **I love it!** Here&#8217;s why:

  1. **You get to create stuff.** When I was a kid I used to daydream about inventing things.  When I program something, I am *creating* something that didn&#8217;t exist before.
  2. **It&#8217;s challenging.** Being faced with different problems to solve causes my mind to be actively engaged.
  3. **It&#8217;s powerful.** I can do things with software that are virtually impossible without it. Knowing how to leverage technology can open the door to new possibilities.
  4. **It&#8217;s fun!** I know it may sound crazy to &#8220;normal&#8221; people, but when I program I am having fun (most of the time at least).  No, really, fun like the fun I had as a kid going to the water park in the summertime or playing football with the guys in the neighborhood.
