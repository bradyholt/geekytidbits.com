A few weeks ago [Houston Techfest 2017](http://www.houstontechfest.com/) was held and I was honored to be a speaker.  My talk was called "Controlling the Amazon Echo with JavaScript" and it was fun to prepare for and to present!

Here is the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FVZNNydOBIe7JOPXx-Zrf1ZqAA8gOzIdFVuJvVtkzRo/edit?usp=sharing):

The example skill is demonstrated was called "Guitar Ace" and the source code for it is here on GitHub: [https://github.com/bradymholt/alexa-guitar-ace](https://github.com/bradymholt/alexa-guitar-ace).
