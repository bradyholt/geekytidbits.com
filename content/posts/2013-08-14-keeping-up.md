The world of software development changes fast.  *Really* fast.  Things that were hot yesterday are history and new trends are constantly emerging.  Even just 5 years ago, the following did not exist or were very new to the development landscape: Node.js, Git, Javascript MVC frameworks, iOS, Android, NoSQL databases, HTML 5, Ruby on Rails, Cloud Computing, ASP.NET MVC, CoffeeScript, SASS, Entity Framework, etc. etc.  **It&#8217;s hard to keep up.**

### Why Keep Up?

As a software developer, I must keep up.

Well, for one, because **I want to remain employed**.  If I held on to my Visual Basic 6 and InterDev skills and refused to learn new things, it would be tough to find a job today.

Secondly, I need to keep up with technology changes that **make me a better, more efficient developer**.  Although new stuff is most definitely *not *always better, sometimes it actually is.  Sometimes new stuff changes the game.  I was hesitant to learn jQuery when all the cool kids were doing it but once I took the plunge, it radically changed my approach to web development.  It made it easier, faster and more enjoyable.

Also, keeping up **keeps me challenged**.  New technologies or new ways of doing the same thing keeps things interesting by providing new challenges and learning opportunities.  I&#8217;m only human and have to realize that a lack of challenge will cause my interests to wane.  If Turbo Pascal was still my primary development language, I would be completely bored out of my mind.  I would be an expert, yes, but there would not be much left to learn.  And, yes, I would be unemployed.

### Challenges To Keeping Up

As I see it, there are 2 primary challenges to keeping up.  The first challenge is just **making myself  aware** of the changes.  How do I sort through all the new buzz words I see and hear?  How do I make time to read blogs and articles, attend conferences and rub shoulders with developers I don&#8217;t directly work with?  Where do I look for the latest trends?  Am I looking in the right place or limiting myself  to a specific community which is skewing my view of larger trends?

Also, **sifting through all the information and deciding what to focus on is tough**.  How do I distinguish a fad from a legitimate trend change?  Time is precious and I can&#8217;t spend time learning every new thing that is hot off the press but at the same time I cannot sit by and not attempt to try to learn some.  Sure, I can wait until a new technology or trend gets a large movement behind it before diving in but how do I decide the point at which this happens?  I do not merely want &#8220;jump on the bandwagon&#8221; of what&#8217;s popular but do want to embrace new trends that make me a better developer and keep me challenged *now*.  If I wait too long, I might be spending my time on something that is on its way to becoming obsolete.

### My Approach

I&#8217;m not confident I know the best way to keep up but I will share my approach in hopes of helping others a bit and to illicit feedback so I can tweak it and make it better.

  * **Read RSS Feeds &#8211; **First and foremost, I subscribe to RSS feeds and use <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Google Reader</span> <a href="http://www.feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a> to read through them.  When I stumble upon a blog post on a site that seems to have quality posts related to things I am interested in, I add it to my list of feeds.   I do not read through my feed list every day but try to skim at least weekly.  When I see something that catches my eye, I try to do a quick read to get the gist.
  * **Explore GitHub** &#8211; <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is pretty popular these days and there are tons of open source repositories hosted there (<a href="https://github.com/bradyholt?tab=repositories" target="_blank">including mine!</a>).  At least weekly, I try and <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">Explore</a> at bit to see what&#8217;s new and whats &#8220;trending&#8221;.
  * **Attend Developer Conferences &#8211;** I try to attend local developer conferences because I feel they are a great way to get a high level idea of the current trends in development.  Just by looking at the session titles and descriptions I can see what current interests are out there, at least locally.  Attending some of the sessions gives me just enough to chew on so I can go learn more on my own.  Also, attending conferences is a great way to network and reconnect with developer friends who I haven&#8217;t seen in awhile.
  * **Search Google &#8211;** Every so often, I simply search Google for something like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=development+trends" target="_blank">&#8220;trends in software development&#8221;</a> and learn from others who have taken the time to research at a high level what the latest trends are.  There are <a href="http://blog.mostof.it/top-5-trends-in-software-development/" target="_blank">some quality articles</a> out there that help me to get a handle on where things are headed.
  * **Experiment with a Personal Project** &#8211;  I maintain an envelope based budgeting project called bento.  It&#8217;s mostly for personal use but I may turn it into something larger one of these days.  I like to use this project to experiment with new tools, libraries and frameworks I come across to take them for a spin.  Since bude is relatively small, it is easy to make incremental changes and switch out components without much trouble.  Also, since I actually use it personally, I get a chance to actively evaluate the development *and maintainability* of something new in a psuedo-real word application rather than a throw away project.
