      <p>The world of software development changes fast.  <em>Really</em> fast.  Things that were hot yesterday are history and new trends are constantly emerging.  Even just 5 years ago, the following did not exist or were very new to the development landscape: Node.js, Git, Javascript MVC frameworks, iOS, Android, NoSQL databases, HTML 5, Ruby on Rails, Cloud Computing, ASP.NET MVC, CoffeeScript, SASS, Entity Framework, etc. etc.  <strong>It’s hard to keep up.</strong></p>

  <p style="padding:15px;"><strong>Turbo Pascal</strong>: It had its day but that day has now passed.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="why-keep-up">Why Keep Up?</h3>

<p>As a software developer, I must keep up.</p>

<p>Well, for one, because <strong>I want to remain employed</strong>.  If I held on to my Visual Basic 6 and InterDev skills and refused to learn new things, it would be tough to find a job today.</p>

<p>Secondly, I need to keep up with technology changes that <strong>make me a better, more efficient developer</strong>.  Although new stuff is most definitely <em>not </em>always better, sometimes it actually is.  Sometimes new stuff changes the game.  I was hesitant to learn jQuery when all the cool kids were doing it but once I took the plunge, it radically changed my approach to web development.  It made it easier, faster and more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Also, keeping up <strong>keeps me challenged</strong>.  New technologies or new ways of doing the same thing keeps things interesting by providing new challenges and learning opportunities.  I’m only human and have to realize that a lack of challenge will cause my interests to wane.  If Turbo Pascal was still my primary development language, I would be completely bored out of my mind.  I would be an expert, yes, but there would not be much left to learn.  And, yes, I would be unemployed.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-to-keeping-up">Challenges To Keeping Up</h3>

<p><amp-img class=" wp-image-1743 pull-left" alt="overwhelmed" src="/media/overwhelmed.jpg" width="282" height="135" layout="responsive"><noscript><img class=" wp-image-1743 pull-left" alt="overwhelmed" src="/media/overwhelmed.jpg" width="282" height="135"></noscript></amp-img></p>

<p>As I see it, there are 2 primary challenges to keeping up.  The first challenge is just <strong>making myself  aware</strong> of the changes.  How do I sort through all the new buzz words I see and hear?  How do I make time to read blogs and articles, attend conferences and rub shoulders with developers I don’t directly work with?  Where do I look for the latest trends?  Am I looking in the right place or limiting myself  to a specific community which is skewing my view of larger trends?</p>

<p>Also, <strong>sifting through all the information and deciding what to focus on is tough</strong>.  How do I distinguish a fad from a legitimate trend change?  Time is precious and I can’t spend time learning every new thing that is hot off the press but at the same time I cannot sit by and not attempt to try to learn some.  Sure, I can wait until a new technology or trend gets a large movement behind it before diving in but how do I decide the point at which this happens?  I do not merely want “jump on the bandwagon” of what’s popular but do want to embrace new trends that make me a better developer and keep me challenged <em>now</em>.  If I wait too long, I might be spending my time on something that is on its way to becoming obsolete.</p>

<h3 id="my-approach">My Approach</h3>

<p>I’m not confident I know the best way to keep up but I will share my approach in hopes of helping others a bit and to illicit feedback so I can tweak it and make it better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Read RSS Feeds – </strong>First and foremost, I subscribe to RSS feeds and use <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Google Reader</span> <a href="http://www.feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a> to read through them.  When I stumble upon a blog post on a site that seems to have quality posts related to things I am interested in, I add it to my list of feeds.   I do not read through my feed list every day but try to skim at least weekly.  When I see something that catches my eye, I try to do a quick read to get the gist.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Explore GitHub</strong> – <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is pretty popular these days and there are tons of open source repositories hosted there (<a href="https://github.com/bradyholt?tab=repositories" target="_blank">including mine!</a>).  At least weekly, I try and <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">Explore</a> at bit to see what’s new and whats “trending”.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Attend Developer Conferences –</strong> I try to attend local developer conferences because I feel they are a great way to get a high level idea of the current trends in development.  Just by looking at the session titles and descriptions I can see what current interests are out there, at least locally.  Attending some of the sessions gives me just enough to chew on so I can go learn more on my own.  Also, attending conferences is a great way to network and reconnect with developer friends who I haven’t seen in awhile.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Search Google –</strong> Every so often, I simply search Google for something like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=development+trends" target="_blank">“trends in software development”</a> and learn from others who have taken the time to research at a high level what the latest trends are.  There are <a href="http://blog.mostof.it/top-5-trends-in-software-development/" target="_blank">some quality articles</a> out there that help me to get a handle on where things are headed.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Experiment with a Personal Project</strong> –  I maintain an envelope based budgeting project called bento.  It’s mostly for personal use but I may turn it into something larger one of these days.  I like to use this project to experiment with new tools, libraries and frameworks I come across to take them for a spin.  Since bude is relatively small, it is easy to make incremental changes and switch out components without much trouble.  Also, since I actually use it personally, I get a chance to actively evaluate the development <em>and maintainability</em> of something new in a psuedo-real word application rather than a throw away project.</li>
