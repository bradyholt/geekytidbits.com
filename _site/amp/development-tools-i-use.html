      <p>It’s been 5 years since I wrote the post <a href="http://www.geekytidbits.com/my-development-toolbelt/">My Development Toolbelt</a>, inspired to do so by the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/tools">Hanselman</a>.  I thought it was time to write another post on the development tools I use today, in 2016.  So, here we go.</p>

<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
<p>When working with actual source code, and the construction of it, these are my go to tools.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> (a.k.a. “Code”) - I love this code editor.  After switching off of Visual Studio as my go to IDE, I tried Sublime Text, Atom, WebStorm, Vim, and RubyMine.  Some were better than others but I eventually settled on Code as my primary editor/debugger.  It rocks.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> - Yes, I’m a Git source control guy.  Along with everyone else.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> - Yes, I use GitHub to store Git repos and collaborate, along with everyone else.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> - I’m still using this gem for file diffs and 3-way merges.  I was thrilled to learn they released an OS X version that works great.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> - A simple, CLI based HTTP proxy.  I used to be a <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> guy when I used Windows primarily but unfortunately the Fiddler version for OS X is straight up bad.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.regexr.com/">RegExr</a> - RegEx made easy.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://donatstudios.com/CsvToMarkdownTable">CSV To Markdown Table</a> - This website comes in handy when I have CSV output (say, from a db query) that I need to display in Markdown (say in a GitHub issue).</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">JSON Formatter and Validator</a> - Makes JSON pretty.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.generatedata.com/">GenerateData.com</a> - Generates sample/fake datasets to use in prototypes or for testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="devops--cloud">DevOps / Cloud</h2>

<p>To get code built, tested, and promoted to different environments, the following tools are invaluable for me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a> - Continuous Integration and build management server. TeamCity is <em>still</em> amazing.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> - I’ve started using Jenkins at work and although I prefer TeamCity for CI, Jenkins is pretty good (and free!).</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> - I use AWS primarily for S3 and EC2 machines.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/974ef9a471c1">Digital Ocean</a> - Although I do use AWS EC2 for machines, I have been using DO more and more for machines that run my personal projects.  Although DO doesn’t have as many features as AWS/EC2, it is catching up quickly.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> - From the website: “Deploy apps.  Manage Systems.  Crush Complexity”.  Yeah, that pretty much explains it.  I use Ansible to provision <em>and</em> deploy apps.  It makes things automated and scriptable.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> - I use VirtualBox to create isolated dev environments locally.  Although, I’ve been veering more towards <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for this type of thing lately.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.navicat.com">Navicat</a> - I use Navicat for PostgreSQL and SQLite management.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser">DB Browser for SQLite</a> - Great tool for super quick access to a SQLite database.  It has very minimal features but is handy for trival things.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<p>These are the tools and software I use for my base development machine setup.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">OS X / El Capitan</a> - I switched over to OSX a few years ago as my primary desktop OS for development.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> - I was a longtime hold-out from using a password manager but since I dived in, I’ve never looked back.  In LastPass, I store website passwords, system credentials, software license keys, RSA Key Pairs, and other misc <em>secret</em> stuff I need to reference from time to time.  It’s nice having everything centralized and secure.  I tried 1Password for awhile but the Android (my mobile platform of choice) client for LastPass is <em>much</em> better in LastPass.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> - I use VirtualBox to run Windows 10, <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a> boxes and some Linix distros I play around with.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM">Retina Display Manager</a> - When I am out with my laptop somewhere and don’t have my external monitors, I just crank my resolution up to something super high so I have more screen real estate.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12">BetterSnapTool</a> - I use this to resize windows in OS X, particularly to snap windows to the left/right on my monitors.  It allows you to accomplish what you can do with Windows+<right> or Windows+<left> in Windows 10.</left></right>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> - I prefer Zsh over Bash.  It has a lot of convienent, productive features.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh My Zsh</a> - Oh My Zsh manages Zsh config and makes adding in themes and plugins trival.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="misc-tools">Misc Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> - Record screen video as an animated GIF.  This is super handy when I want to record my screen and post an animated GIF in a GitHub PR / Issue for others to easily see.  I prefer the simplicity of this tool rather than using something heavier like Jing or CloudApp.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn?hl=en">Page Ruler</a> (Chrome Extension) - From the website: “Draw a ruler to get pixel dimensions and positioning, and measure elements on any web page.”  Yep, that’s what it does.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en">Awesome Screenshot</a>  (Chrome Extension) - I love this tool and can’t live without it.  This makes taking screenshots (and optionally annotating them) dead simple.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/bradymholt/dotfiles/tree/master/bin">bash scripts</a> - I have a collection of bash scripts for handy things like abstracting Git commands and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ws</code> for starting a lightweight webserver from the current directory.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.photoshop.com/products/photoshopelements">Photoshop Elements</a> - I use this for image editing when I need to do something non-trival.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reference">Reference</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> - I’m unashamed to say I use SO (along with everyone else!) all the time and it would probably take me significantly longer to get stuff done without it.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> - Twitter is a great resource for staying up to date with tidbits in software development.  I avoided Twitter for years because I considered it distracting and purely social but it turns out I learn a ton of stuff just by following smart people on there. You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/bradymholt">@bradyholt</a>.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  I read this daily, along with everyone else.  You can learn a ton a stuff on here.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">Reddit</a> - The /r/programming subreddit is a great resource to keep up with interesting articles and news.</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> - When I come across a blog or a site that has great content, I will add it to my Feedly list and read through new articles from time to time.  Also, I have a “Podcast” category in here which is a great way to follow the podcasts I like to listen to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, a lot has changed from 5 years ago!</p>
