      <p><span style="background-color: yellow;">Update: Check out my improved setup: <a href="/my-free-iphone-setup-2-0/">My Free iPhone Setup with FreedomPop</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have a perennial conflict between wanting geeky toys and saving money. Usually those two things are mutually exclusive but sometimes I am able to have both.</p>

<p>The iPhone is a perfect example of this. I’ve had an iPhone for 2 years and love it. I got it for my birthday so I didn’t have to talk myself into the expensive data plan but after having it for a few weeks I decided the cost was worth it because it is such a useful (and cool) device.</p>

<p>After my wife’s iPhone got stolen and I gave her mine to use I started thinking about alternatives to paying AT&amp;T an arm and a leg for their plan. I had read a few articles over the years in passing about using an iPod Touch as a free iPhone but didn’t ever seriously consider it. However, since I was without a phone and not wanting to renew my contract for 2 years (i.e. spend over $2,000), I decided to give the iPod Touch setup a try.</p>

<p>I did a bunch of reading of blogs about how others accomplished this and decided it was feasible.  Everyone that I found had a slightly different configuration but they all seemed to be happy with the end result.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>The major pieces to my setup are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod Touch</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="https://voice.google.com" target="_blank">Google Voice</a> account</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.talkatone.com/" target="_blank">Talkatone</a> app</li>

</ul>

  The basic idea is that I have a Google Voice number as my main phone number.  When calls come in to that number, I have 4 different physical devices  (“forwarding  phones”) setup to take the call.  Depending upon where I am and whether I have access to WiFi, I will hear the call come in on one of these devices.  When I am at work, my work phone will ring.  When I am at home, my iPod touch will ring, when I am out and about, my wife’s iPhone will ring, and when I am in my car, my prepaid cell phone will ring.  There are very few scenarios with this setup that I am “unreachable”.  Also, outgoing calls can be made from any of these devices.

<p><a href="http://www.talkatone.com/" target="_blank">Talkatone</a> is an awesome iOS app that leverages Google Voice to give your iPod Touch inbound and outbound calling functionality over WiFi.  You simply download the <strong>free</strong> app from the App Store and then give it your Google Voice account information when fire it up for the first time.  It runs in the background and has many options so you can fine tune it to your liking.  I was honestly skeptical about this app at first and thought it might not be reliable but I have continually been impressed with it.  Once this app is running and you are connected to WiFi, incoming calls to your Google Voice number will magically ring on the iPod Touch and you will be given the option to accept them.  The app is able to handle intermittent Wifi connectivity so when you go from no Wifi to having Wifi connectivity, it will start listening for calls again.  That feature right there is killer.  It means I can build my list of known Wifi hotspots and the iPod Touch will atomically jump on hotspots and start listening for calls, all without me having to touch it.  Talkatone also supports free texting through Google Voice so add that to it’s awesomeness.</p>

<p>3 month break-even!  Not bad.  After that break-even period, the savings goes straight in my pocket.  Actually, if I had gotten another iPhone on contract (to replace the stolen one) I would have ended up spending $200 on it anyway so I could argue my marginal out of pocket cost for the “free” setup is much less (~ $60).</p>

<h3 id="my-experience">My Experience</h3>

<p>I’ve had this setup for a couple of months now and can honestly say it is working well.  I am reachable, able to make calls almost everywhere I am, and am saving bookoos of $.  I basically get an iPhone setup for practically free.</p>

<p>Yes, it is not “as good” as a full blown iPhone setup, however and for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Performance.  </strong>The iPod Touch is not as snappy as the latest iPhone because it doesn’t have as beefy of a processor.  So, the iPod Touch can be sluggish at times but I find it to be acceptable and not too bad.</li>
  <li>
<strong>No Vibrate.  </strong>Ok, some people might not care about this but I was disappointed to find that the iPod Touch does not have a vibrate option.  I used to turn my iPhone ringer off and just rely of the vibrate feature to know when calls were coming in because the phone was always in my pocket.  I liked not having to worry about silencing the phone during meetings and such.  If, however, you jailbreak your iPod Touch you can install programs like <a href="http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=sbprofilesDp" target="_blank">SBProfiles</a> to help.  All in all, this is not a deal breaker but just a downside.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Not Always Connected.  </strong>With my 4 forwarding phones I am pretty darn reachable.  But, since the iPod Touch only has Wifi there are some times when I am out and about and don’t have Wifi.  If I go to get my haircut and the place doesn’t have a hotspot, I don’t have phone or data service.  I could get my prepaid phone from the car and take it in but it would be nice to pull of mobile Safari and surf around while waiting to get my ears lowered.  If I am on the road and there is a huge traffic jam, I can’t pull up my phone to see the traffic info or find an alternate route.  I could call the wife for help, though, with the prepaid phone.   Also, I could pull into a McDonald’s parking lot to jump on Wifi to check traffic. Yes, this sucks that I’m not “always connected” but honestly, it doesn’t suck as bad as I thought it would.  I don’t find myself saying “Arrrgggh!! I don’t have Wifi here!”.  Every once in awhile it is a bit painful not being connected but it’s not that bad.  I try to look at the bright side and realize it’s good to be disconnected sometimes.  And, there are so many places with Wifi so chances are I can find a hotspot <em>somewhere</em> near by.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it.  I’m loving my Free iPhone setup and the $ I am saving!</p>
