      <p>I came across a twitter post recently by DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) where he was reflecting back on an anti-Microsoft / Ballmer blog post he wrote back in 2010.  He posted the link shortly after the announcement that Ballmer was leaving MSFT.  The post is obviously a slamming session aimed at Microsoft.  That’s fine, I understand DHH would probably be one of the last people to be on the Microsoft payroll and both he and they (and me!) are probably just fine with that.</p>

<p>However, one of the first comments (shown below) was “you should rename your blog so its initials are “git” instead of “svn”.  <strong>Are you serious?</strong></p>

<p><a href="/media/ddh_git_svn1.png"><amp-img class="size-full wp-image-1839 alignnone" alt="ddh_git_svn" src="/media/ddh_git_svn1.png" width="532" height="362" layout="responsive"><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-1839 alignnone" alt="ddh_git_svn" src="/media/ddh_git_svn1.png" width="532" height="362"></noscript></amp-img></a></p>

<p>Some of the things floating around in my head after seeing this were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are you serious?</li>
  <li>Why in the world does it matter what the Url is for DHH’s blog?</li>
  <li>Why in the world does it matter whether DHH uses Subversion or Git for his blog?</li>
  <li>If Subversion works for him and gets the job done shouldn’t that be just fine?</li>
  <li>This guy (commenter) <em>must</em> be a <strong>hipster</strong>.  “Subversion is <em>so</em> 2005 and if you aren’t using Git, you are so not cool.”</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem I have with the hipster subculture in software development is that “they” focus on being non-mainstream, cool and trendy for no other purpose, seemingly, than to be non-mainstream, cool and trendy.  Getting the job done, productivity and the bigger picture always seem to take a back seat to being hip.</p>

<p>This post was originally intended to be a rant. A rant about the <a href="http://www.petrikainulainen.net/software-development/technology-evaluation/the-way-of-the-hipster/" target="_blank">hipster developers</a>.  As I started to write my rant, though, I realized something.  I succumb to the hipster mentality from time to time myself.  Since I do love technology and development, I naturally get intrigued by new, shiny tools and technologies and want to learn and start using them.  It keeps things interesting and fun.  And, when I use these new tools I do start to feel kinda “hip” and cool.  And who doesn’t want to feel hip and cool from time to time?</p>

<p>The problem comes, though, when I start to get the “you’re doing it wrong” mentality.  If someone else is doing something “un-hip” and I start to criticize them for that, I need to stop.  Different tools work for different people and needs.  If a tool exists that will get  the job done well why not use it?  Even it is is old.  Even if it is not cool.</p>
